# Hosting n8n on Porter Cloud

This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Porter Cloud. It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend.

## Prerequisites

You must have a Postgres instance in order to use n8n. You can either provide the connection information of an existing instance, or provision a new one for free via the Porter Cloud Datastores offering.

## Use the deploy to Porter button to one-click deploy n8n

The quickest way to get started with deploying n8n to Porter Cloud is using the **Deploy to Porter** button:

[![Deploy](https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/porter/images/deploying-applications/deploy-to-porter.svg)](https://cloud.porter.run/addons/new?addon_name=quivr)

After sign-up or login, you will be redirected to the n8n form, where you can specify configuration for the n8n instance you are about to deploy.
